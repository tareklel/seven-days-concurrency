Day 1
Usually when I grasp a concept I really enjoy if I don't practice it for a specific period, I'll forget it. 
So I've decided to talk about concurrency in programming for 7 days for it to stick. Why is concurrency amazing? 
Below are two pieces of code that do the same thing, read webpages, but one take 0.9-1.6 seconds to run while the other takes 5-6 seconds to run. 
The first one runs 5 times as fast because of concurrency, a significant performance boost. 
How was this achieved? 
In the first piece of code, multiple execution flows called threads execute functions to read websites 
concurrently without having to wait for previous functions to complete the entirety of their task. 
Since they're not waiting on external events to complete, such as waiting for a response from a website, a new task can start and exevute code in the meantime. 
So overall more gets done when waiting time is put to good use! Tomorrow I'll talk about where concurrency can go wrong.
